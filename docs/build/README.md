# Build

Filecash is for the builders. If you are excited about the potential of leveraging the Filecash protocol and decentralized storage network to build game-changing applications, you've come to the right place.

[[TOC]]

## Onboard the testnet

The Filecash testnet is a network with parameters and activity levels _as close as possible_ to the expected state of the Filecash mainnet once it launches. To get up to speed quickly on how to start storing data on the testnet, check the [onboard the testnet](onboard-testnet.md) guide.

## Filecash-backed storage providers

The following products provide storage solutions that are backed up by the Filecash network and potentially [integrate IPFS as a hot-data layer (FPS)](filecash-pinning-services.md).

::: tip
We plan to update this list regularly as new providers are announced and their features expand.

## Hosted nodes

Hosted node providers take care of running Filecash node software for you so that you can focus on integrating and building on top of it.
